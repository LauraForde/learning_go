2. Write a program that defines a string variable called *message* with the value "Hi üë© and üë®" and prints the fourth rune in it as a character, not a number.
3. Write a program that defines a struct *Employee* with three fields: *firstName, lastName* and *id*. The first two fields are type of *string*, and the last field (*id*) is of type *int*. Create three instances of this struct using whatever values you'd like. Initialize the first one using the struct literal style without names, the second using the struct literal style with names, and the third with a *var* declaration. Use dot notation to populate the fields in the third struct. Print out all three structs.
